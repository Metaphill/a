In Italy, to contain the spread of infection a severe lockdown in the spring 2020 was instituted. Other less severe restrictions were imposed in the winter 2020–2021 and in the spring 2021. The containment measures caused a series of consequences for the population and, in particular, for children and adolescents that presented psychophysical problems. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the serum levels of vitamin D in children and adolescents before, during and after the lockdown consequent to COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study, including all children and adolescents between 1 to 18 years referring to the Pediatric Endocrinology Service of the University Hospital of Verona, Italy, between January 2019 and December 2021. All patients affected by clinical conditions that involve vitamin D metabolism or assuming vitamin D supplementation were excluded. Results In total, 491 children (36.7% males and 63.3% females) were enrolled in this study. The vitamin D levels decreased over time: 28.3 ± 10.2 ng/mL in 2019; 28.2 ± 11.4 ng/mL in 2020 and 24.9 ± 10.1 ng/mL in 2021 (p < 0.05). The vitamin D levels are significant higher in summer and in autumn in comparison with the levels of winter and spring, regardless of the examined years. Conclusions The measures adopted to contain the COVID-19 pandemic led to a reduction of serum levels of vitamin D in pediatric population, probably due to the reduced solar exposure. This may have severe consequences on the bone metabolism of those children who did not present optimal vitamin D levels even before the lockdown. Therefore, an adequate supplementation of vitamin D is necessary from the end of fall to the beginning of spring (November–April) in all children and adolescents living in Northern Italy.

During the pandemic, COVID-19 children were obliged to home confinement, which potentially limiting sunlight exposure. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether home confinement led to decreased vitamin D serum levels in children in Warsaw, Poland. Methods: The study included 1472 children who were divided into two groups, based on the date of 25(OH)D level blood sampling: before and during the pandemic. Children under 1 year of age (infants) were analysed separately. Results: A statistically significant decrease in the average level of vitamin D was observed between groups of children over 1 year of age (35 ng/mL ± 18 vs. 31 ng/mL ± 14). In infants from both groups, the mean vitamin D levels were within the normal range (Group 1 inf 54 ng/mL ± 21 vs. Group 2 inf 47 ng/mL ± 15). The characteristic seasonal variability was observed before the pandemic, with maximal vitamin D levels in summer (40 ng/mL ± 17) and minimal levels in winter (30 ng/mL ± 14). During the pandemic, no seasonal variability was observed (summer 30 ng/mL ± 11 vs. winter 30 ng/mL ± 19). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions led to a significant decrease in vitamin D serum levels in children.

We retrospectively studied vitamin 25-(OH) D blood levels in 2182 Italian children/adolescents hospitalized for various chronic diseases in the year before (n = 1052) and after (n = 1130) the nationwide lockdown. The type of underlying disease, gender, and mean age (91 ± 55 and 91 ± 61 months, respectively) of patients included in the two periods were comparable. Although mean levels were the same (p = 0.24), deficiency status affected a significantly higher number of subjects during the lockdown period than in the pre-COVID period (p = 0.03), particularly in summer (p = 0.02), and there was also a smoothing of seasonal variations in vitamin D levels. Particularly at risk were males (OR = 1.22; p = 0.03), the 1–5 year age group (OR = 1.57; p < 0.01) and the 6–12 year age group (OR = 1.30; p = 0.04). Infants appeared not to be affected (p = 1.00). In the post-COVID period, the risk of vitamin D deficiency was unchanged in disease-specific groups. However, the proportion of deficiency or severe deficiency differed significantly in the subgroup with endocrinopathy (higher; Chi-square p = 0.04), and with respiratory problems and obesity (lower; Chi-square p = 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). Conflicting/opposite literature results advocate for further studies to clearly indicate the need for supplementation during possible future periods of confinement.

The aim of this study was to evaluate vitamin D levels of healthy children and adolescents during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: The study group included healthy children and adolescents who were admitted for general check-ups and evaluated with 25(OH)D levels. Then, it was divided into two groups: Group 1 “pre-pandemic”, and Group 2 “pandemic”. Vitamin D levels were recorded from the hospital database and were compared according to age groups, gender, and the season, retrospectively. Results: The study group [mean age=90.29±59.45 median age=79 interquartile range (IQR): 102 months, male/female: 1409/1624] included 3033 children and adolescents (Group 1/Group 2 n=1864/1169). Although the mean 25(OH)D levels among preschool children did not differ between groups, the vitamin D levels of school-aged children and adolescents were significantly lower in the pandemic period than in the pre-pandemic period [Group 1 median=16.50 (IQR: 10.5) vs Group 2 median=15.9 (IQR: 11.3) in 6-12 age group (p=0.026); Group 1 median=13.30 (IQR: 10.2) vs Group 2 median=11.20 (IQR: 9.7) in 12-18 age group (p=0.003)]. Moreover, the 25(OH)D levels of adolescents showed seasonal variance with lower levels in winter, and unexpectedly, in summer. Conclusion: Pandemic-related restrictions have caused significant decreases in vitamin D levels of school-aged children and adolescents. We suggest that children and adolescents should be given vitamin D supplementation in order to maintain sufficient levels of vitamin D during the pandemic. Keywords: Vitamin D, C

It is supposed that lockdown measures and fear of SARS-CoV-2 infection might reduce vitamin D levels through the modification of lifestyle. However, very few data exist on the association between lockdown measures and vitamin D status in humans. For this cross-sectional comparative study, adolescents (n = 298) aged 18 to 19 years were enrolled during the compulsory military fitness-for-duty evaluation between July and December 2020 in Southern Switzerland. Beyond anthropometric measurements, participants filled in a structured questionnaire about their lifestyle and a blood specimen was sampled for the determination of total 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. The obtained data were compared with those of 437 adolescents enrolled at the military fitness-for-duty evaluation during the same period of the year in the context of the CENERI study (2014–2016). The anthropometric measures were similar between the two study groups. The levels of vitamin D were also comparable (77 (64–91) vs. 74 (60–92) nmol/L, p = 0.50; median and interquartile range). A total of 38 (13%) and 43 (9.8%) subjects presented insufficient (<50 nmol/L) levels of vitamin D (p = 0.42) during the current pandemic and in the CENERI study, respectively. These data do not support the hypothesis that during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, late adolescents are at higher risk of vitamin insufficiency.

This study aimed to quantify changes in vitamin D level among infants and toddlers in Hong Kong after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We recruited 303 infants and toddlers aged 2–24 months by stratified random sampling from 1 June 2019 to November 30, 2020. Regression models were used to estimate the effect of time on infants’ serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level overall and by age groups before and after the outbreak. Interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to examine the sustained effect of COVID-19 on their serum 25(OH)D level. Results: The ITS results showed no immediate reduction in serum 25(OH)D level among infants, but a decreasing trend was observed in the subsequent months post-outbreak at a monthly decline rate of −6.32 nmol/L. When analyzed by age group, the magnitude of post-outbreak reduction in 25(OH)D was stronger among younger infants (aged 2–6 months). Conclusion: Guidelines and recommendations should be given to pregnant women and mothers to ensure sufficient vitamin D level in their infants during the COVID-19 period.

Its physiological functions include increasing calcium serum concentrations. 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D) (Calcifediol), a non-active, circulating instant precursor is seen as a pre-hormone. Studies have shown that a deficiency in calcifediol is related to chronic conditions such as cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, immune system, neurological, and anti-neoplastic functions. Vitamin D supplementation has shown its benefit as prophylaxis and treatment during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and an increase in the prescribing of vitamin D supplementation has been observed. The intention of this review article is to provide guidance on the recommended dosage regimen as a prophylactic measure during COVID-19 and its use as a supplement in general. From this review article, it is clear that vitamin D has an important role to play not only in COVID-19 but also in various other health aspects of the human body. Contribution: This review article highlighted the role of vitamin D in managing vitamin D deficiency and its role as a supplement in the management of respiratory tract infections, especially COVID-19. This overview can assist physicians in optimising healthcare by optimised dosing recommendations and indications. Previous article Next article We recommend

Method Forty elite young soccer players (age: 17.2 ± 1.16 years, body mass: 70.2 ± 5.84, and body height: 179.1 ± 4.26 cm) participated in the research. Only 24 players completed the measurements during all four time- points (T1-: September 2019, T2-: December 2019, T3-: May 2020, and T4-: August 2020) and were divided into two subgroups: supplemented group (GS) and placebo group (GP). Players from GS received 5,000 IU of vitamin D for 8 weeks (January-MarchJanuary–March 2020). Several biomarkers such as 25(OH)D, white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), muscle damage markersmarkers, and lipid profile were measured. Results AnalysisThe analysis of the total group demonstrated significant seasonal changes in 25(OH)D, HGB, asparagine aminotransferaseaminotransferase, and creatine kinase along the one1-year training cycle. The level of 25(OH)D concentrationinconcentration in T4 was significantly (p < 0.001, pη [ = 0.82) higher in both subgroups in comparison to T2 and T3. Moreover, the significant (p = 0.023) but poor (r = −0.23) correlation between 25(OH)D and WBC was calculated. Conclusion Current research confirmed the significant seasonal changes in 25(OH)D concentration during four seasons. 8-weekEight-week vitamin D supplementation had no extended effect on the level of 25(OH)D concentration.

Methods In this retrospective, cross-sectional and methodological study included 86,772 patients (18–75 years) samples who were admitted to the Izmir Dokuz Eylul University Hospital (latitude and longitude (Turkey): 27 E 09; 38 N 25, respectively) for various reasons and whose 25(OH)D levels were measured in the biochemistry unit between 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 (before and during the COVID-19 outbreak). A time series analysis of monthly averages for 25(OH)D was performed. For the purpose of seasonal study, the mean levels of 25(OH)D are grouped by years. Data were modeled in terms of 25(OH)D levels using the MATLAB Curve Fitting Toolbox. Results There was no significant difference between the sexes according to 25(OH)D levels (p>0.05). 25(OH)D levels were significantly higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months (p<0.001). When comparing the spring months, 25(OH)D levels in 2020 (18 ± 10) were found to be significantly lower than in 2019 (22 ± 12) (p<0.001); on the contrary, when examined based on the summer, autumn, and winter months, it was determined that 25(OH)D levels increased in 2020 (summer: 25 ± 13, autumn: 25 ± 14, and winter: 19 ± 10) compared to 2019 (summer: 23 ± 11, autumn: 22 ± 10, and winter: 19 ± 11) (p<0.001). In the estimates curve obtained with an error margin of 11% in the time series analysis, it was estimated that the 25(OH)D averages after the pandemic would be similar to those before the pandemic. Conclusions Restrictions, partial or complete closures, and curfews can significantly affect individuals’ 25(OH)D levels during the COVID-19 outbreak. There is a need for multicenter studies with larger populations covering different regions to strengthen and support our results. Figures

Our aim was to examine the basic characteristics of patients’ vitD status, and the ratio of vitD deficiency and its relation to certain diseases, assess seasonality and trends, and reveal the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vitD3 supplementation at the patient population level. Methods: Anonymized data on 25(OH)D test results were obtained from the clinical data registry of a tertiary teaching hospital covering the period between 1 January 2015 and 30 June 2021. VitD consumption (pharmacy sale) data were retrieved from the database of the National Health Insurance Fund of Hungary in order to calculate the defined daily dose (DDD)/1,000 inhabitants/day. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The two-sample t-test and F-test were used to analyze our patients’ data. Significant differences were considered if p <0.05. Results: Altogether, 45,567 samples were investigated; the mean age was 49 ± 19.1 years and 68.4% of them were female subjects. Overall, 20% of all patients had hypovitaminosis D, and just over 7% of patients had vitD deficiency. Male subjects had higher odds for hypovitaminosis or vitD deficiency (65.4 ± 28.2 nmol/L vs. 68.4 ± 28.4 nmol/L; p <0.0001). The mean 25(OH)D concentration has changed during the year, reaching a peak in September and a minimum in February. Patients with diseases of the circulatory system, genitourinary system, certain conditions originating in the perinatal period, and “sine morbo” (i.e., without a disease; such as those aged over 45 years and female teenagers) had statistically higher odds for lower 25(OH)D concentrations (p <0.00001). VitD consumption showed seasonality, being higher in autumn and winter. A slight increase started in the season of 2017/18, and two huge peaks were detected at the beginning of 2020 and 2021 in association with the COVID-19 waves. Conclusion: Our data are the first to describe data concerning vitD in our region. It reinforces the notion of vitD3 supplementation for some risk groups and also in healthy individuals. To prevent the winter decline, vitD3 supplementation should be started in September. This and the results during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the importance of health education encouraging vitamin D3 supplementation.

The purpose of our study was to compare 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels in patients hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 during two waves of the pandemic (2020/21 vs. 2021/22). A total of 101 patients from the 2021/22 wave were compared with 101 sex- and age-matched subjects from the 2020/21 wave. Patients from both groups were hospitalized during the winter season from 1 December to 28 February. Men and women were analyzed together and separately. The mean 25(OH)D concentration increased from 17.8 ± 9.7 ng/mL to 25.2 ± 12.6 ng/mL between waves. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) decreased from 82% to 54%. The prevalence of adequate serum 25(OH)D concentration (>30 ng/mL) increased from 10% to 34% (p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with a history of vitamin D supplementation increased from 18% to 44% (p < 0.0001). Low serum 25(OH)D concentration was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for age and sex for the whole cohort of patients (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of inadequate vitamin D status in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Slovakia decreased significantly, probably due to a higher rate of vitamin D supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent Lebanese studies demonstrated an improvement in vitamin D status over time. However, the comparison between the years before and during the COVID-19 outbreak has never been analyzed in the Middle-East area. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and the predictors of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels during the last 7 years. Methods Serum 25(OH)D levels from a large laboratory database were retrospectively collected from Hôtel-Dieu de France Hospital between January 2016 and June 2022 (N = 66,127). Data related to age, gender, season and year of sampling were also retrieved. Results Mean age of the population was 50.6 ± 19 years, 62.7% were women, 5.3% were children and adolescents, 67.6% adults and 27% elderly. Mean serum 25(OH)D level was 25.7 ± 11.9 ng/mL. The overall population with vitamin D sufficiency (>30 ng/mL) was 31.9%. The increase in mean serum 25(OH)D observed between 2016 and 2022 was 6.36 ng/mL (p < 0.0001). The prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency (<30 ng/mL) decreased from 76.2% in 2016 to 56.5% in 2022 (p < 0.0001) with a significant difference between the period before and during the COVID-19 outbreak (72.3% vs.42.5%, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate logistic regression, older age, female sex, summer season, years of the COVID-19 outbreak and outpatient samples were protective factors against the risk of hypovitaminosis D (p < 0.0001 for all variables). Conclusion Our study showed a continuous positive change in vitamin D status time, most notably after the COVID-19 outbreak. Further studies are needed to assess the clinical impact of the pandemic on vitamin D status in our population.

Changes in vitamin D status among adults from the COVID-19 pandemic to post-pandemic normality Yanzhao Chen Yanzhao Chen*Guilian Kong Guilian Kong* Demonstration Laboratory of Quality Control for in vitro Analysis, Department of Nuclear Medicine, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, The Clinical Medical College of Provincial Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted widespread lockdown measures globally, significantly impacting daily activities and outdoor exposure. This study investigates the effect of the pandemic on vitamin D levels and the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the adult population, with a focus on gender-specific differences. Methods: A total of 1525 adults from Henan Provincial People’s Hospital were included. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured using the Elecsys® Vitamin D total kit on the Roche Cobas® 8000 analyzer. The Clinical Application Consensus on Vitamin D and Its Analogs defined deficiency as 25(OH)D levels below 20 ng/ml. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 23.0 and GraphPad Prism 8 software. Results: The overall 25(OH)D levels increased from 18.14 ng/ml [IQR: 13.78, 23.68] in 2022 to 19.15 ng/ml [IQR: 14.88, 25.01] in 2023 (p=0.004). Males exhibited significant improvement in 25(OH)D levels from 18.01 ng/ml [IQR: 14.10, 23.53] in 2022 to 20.49 ng/ml [IQR: 16.11, 26.01] in 2023 (p<0.001). The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency decreased from 62% in 2022 to 54.9% in 2023 (p=0.009), with a notable reduction in males (64.1% in 2022 to 47.2% in 2023). Among 168 individuals tested in both years, 25(OH)D levels increased from 20.73 ± 9.37 ng/ml in 2022 to 22.28 ± 8.59 ng/ml in 2023 (p=0.012), and the deficiency rate decreased from 58.3% in 2022 to 47.0% in 2023 (p=0.038). The 40–49 age group showed significant improvement in 25(OH)D levels from 16.10 ng/ml [IQR: 12.41, 21.18] in 2022 to 18.28 ng/ml [IQR: 13.91, 23.86] in 2023 (p=0.005), with a reduction in deficiency rate from 72.8% to 59.9% (p=0.02). Furthermore, in February, March, and April, 2022, 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower compared to 2023 (p<0.001, p=0.002, p<0.001, respectively), accompanied by a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (p<0.001, p=0.015, p<0.001, respectively). Discussion: This study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted vitamin D levels, leading to an increased prevalence of deficiency, particularly among males. These findings highlight the critical importance of maintaining sufficient outdoor activities to ensure adequate vitamin D levels. The data underscore the need for public health strategies to address potential deficiencies during prolonged periods of limited outdoor exposure.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of lockdown measures on 25(OH)D levels in outpatients visiting the healthcare centre over a period of two years. In this retrospective chart review, outpatients who visited a university healthcare centre for a health check-up over a period of two years were included. The patients’ 25(OH)D serum levels and status were compared before, during, and after the lockdown periods. A total of 7234 patients were included in this study, with a mean age of 34.66 ± 16.78. The overall prevalence of 25(OH)D insufficiency, deficiency and sufficiency was 33.8%, 30.7% and 35.4%, respectively. The proportion of individuals with 25-(OH) D deficiency prior to lockdown was 29% and this proportion increased in the lockdown and post-lockdown periods to 31.1% and 32%, respectively. Although gender was less likely to have an impact on the 25 (OH) D level during the lockdown period (p = 0.630), we found an association between gender and 25 (OH) D status in the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown periods (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Another association between nationality and 25 (OH)D levels was found before, during and after the lockdown periods (p < 0.001). In addition, the youngest population, aged between 1 and 14, was strongly affected by the home confinement. Age had a positive and significant (p < 0.05) effect on 25 (OH) D status regardless of the different periods. Moreover, in the pre-lockdown period, male outpatients had 1.56 chance of having a sufficient level of 25 (OH)D. However, during the lockdown period, this chance decreased to 0.85 and then increased to 0.99 after the lockdown period. We found no statistically significant difference in the mean serum concentrations or in the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency when we compared values from before, during and immediately after the COVID-19 lockdown period. However, there was a generally increased prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in our study population. Another association between gender, nationality and age groups with 25(OH) D was found. Regular exposure to UVR is recommended for maintaining adequate vitamin D levels and to prevent vitamin D deficiency. Further research is needed to determine the best indications for vitamin D supplementation if confinement periods are extended and to consider the potential health consequences of prolonged confinement periods not only on vitamin D status but also on overall public health. The findings of this study may be considered by stakeholders for a targeted supplementation approach for risk groups.

The present study sought to examine the prevalence and correlates of vitamin D deficiency among healthcare workers three years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants comprised 2543 staff members from a medical research institute, who completed a questionnaire and donated blood samples in June 2023. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio and its 95% confidence interval while adjusting for covariates. Results The proportions of participants with vitamin D insufficiency (25[OH]D 20–29 ng/mL) and deficiency (25[OH]D < 20 ng/mL) were 44.9% and 45.9%, respectively. In a multivariable-adjusted model, factors associated with a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency included younger age, female sex, fewer hours of daytime outdoor physical activity during leisure time (without regular use of sunscreen), lower intake of fatty fish, no use of vitamin D supplements, smoking, and no alcohol consumption. Occupational factors, including shift work, were not independently associated with vitamin D deficiency. Conclusions Our results suggest that vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are highly prevalent among healthcare workers. Health education regarding lifestyle modifications for this occupational group are warranted to improve their vitamin D status in the COVID-19 era.

Abstract Background Vitamin D is an essential fat-soluble vitamin thought to be associated with chronic diseases, mortality and COVID-19. Objective To investigate the association between 25(OH) vitamin D levels and mortality of chronic diseases in subjects aged ≥65 years before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A single-center, retrospective study was performed using the hospital database of subjects aged 65 years and older who had undergone vitamin D measurement between 01.01.2019 and 31.12.2021. All patients with vitamin D measurement (N = 2155) were followed as a cohort from the date of serum vitamin D analysis through death date or 01.01.2022. Age, gender, chronic diseases, survival status, date of death of the deceased, laboratory values including complete blood count, liver/renal functions and 25(OH) vitamin D levels were all noted. Subjects were classified into three groups according to their 25(OH) vitamin D levels; severe deficient group (<10 ng/ml), moderate deficient group (10–19.9 ng/ml), and control group (≥20 ng/ml). Results Data of 1949 subjects were included in this retrospective analysis and 206 of them (10.6%) had at least two vitamin D measurements. Until the time of data collection (01.01.2022), 94 of the cases had died within the last three years, and only five of them had repeated measurements. While the mean vitamin D level was lower, age and frequency of dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), arrhythmia, dementia and severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) were higher in subjectswho died (all p<0.05). According to the Cox proportional hazards model; age, presence of CAD, COPD, arrhythmia, dementia, anemia and severe vitamin D deficiency were independently related with mortality (all p<0.05). After adjusted by age, gender, and comorbidities, the probability of death was found to be 1.91 (95% CI=1.12–3.24) times higher in the severe vitamin D deficient group. Conclusions The results of this study have shown that - after having adjusted for potential factors - severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) seems to be an independent predictor for non-cancer mortality. Although vitamin D measurement/treatment is very easy and cheap where, on the contrary, severe vitamin D deficiency can be quite mortal.

Data from numerous studies indicate a significant prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Ukraine and the world. In recent years, the Ukrainian medical community has faced two important challenges — the COVID-19 pandemic and the russian aggression, which significantly affected the organization and availability of medical care. Despite the previous epidemiological studies in Ukraine devoted to the vitamin D status, there are no data during the past 5 years that became the background for this research. The purpose was to analyze the vitamin D status in the adult population of Ukraine during the COVID-19 pandemic and russian aggression. Materials and methods. Data of the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in 5029 adults aged 20–99 years, who for various reasons applied for its measurement, were retrospectively analyzed. The analysis was performed depending on the year and month of observation, the age and gender of the subjects, and the 25(OH)D level. Results. The mean serum level of 25(OH)D in the total group was 33.2 [24.1–43.8] ng/ml. The assessment of the number of 25(OH)D tests for 2018–2022 did not reveal any signi­ficant differences in 2018 and 2019 but established a significant decrease during the russian aggression in Ukraine in 2022 (by 55.7 %) compared to 2018, as well as indices during the COVID-19 pandemic (by 21.6 % compared to 2020, by 23.5 % in 2021). During the observation period, it was established a decrease in the vitamin D deficiency proportion from 20.6 % in 2018 to 9.3 % in 2022, and an increase in the proportion of subjects with suboptimal (from 6.6 to 11.4 %, respectively) and high serum concentrations of 25(OH)D (from 2.2 to 12.7 %). Conclusions. Our results indicate a grown serum 25(OH)D level during 2020–2022 in the adult population of Ukraine compared to the indices of previous years and a decreased share of vitamin D deficiency in the Ukrainian population. In addition, a decrease in the number of 25(OH)D level tests was established, especially during the period of the russian aggression, which should be taken into account during the planning measures to optimize the vitamin D status in the adult population of Ukraine.

SectionsPDFTools Share Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as well as its prevention and control measures, seriously affected people's livehood, which may have affected the body's level of vitamin D (VD). This study aimed to investigate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the VD status of children in Zhengzhou, China. In this study, we included 12 272 children in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 16 495 children in 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) to examine the changes in VD levels and deficiency rates among children before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Total VD levels in 2020 were significantly higher than those in 2019 (26.56 [18.15, 41.40] vs. 25.98 [17.92, 40.09] ng/ml, p  < 0.001). Further analysis revealed that during the COVID-19 pandemic control period in 2020, the VD levels in February, March, and April were lower than those in the same months of 2019, while the VD deficiency rates were significantly higher. Additionally, our data revealed that VD levels decreased significantly with age. Among children older than 6 years, the VD deficiency rate exceeded 50%. These results indicate that we should pay close attention to VD supplementation during the COVID-19 pandemic control period and in children older than 6 years of age.

We aim to estimate the global and regional prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in people aged 1 year or older from 2000 to 2022. Methods: We systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Scopus, and Google databases on December 31, 2021, and updated them on August 20, 2022, without language and time restrictions. Meanwhile, we identified references of relevant system reviews and eligible articles and included the latest and unpublished data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2015–2016 and 2017–2018) database. The studies investigating the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in population-based studies were included. A standardized data extraction form was used to collect information from eligible studies. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to estimate the global and regional prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. We stratified meta-analyses by latitude, season, six WHO regions, the World Bank income groups, gender, and age groups. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021292586). Findings: Out of 67,340 records searched, 308 studies with 7,947,359 participants from 81 countries were eligible for this study, 202 (7,634,261 participants), 284 (1,475,339 participants), and 165 (561,978 participants) studies for the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D <30, <50, and <75 nmol/L, respectively. We found that globally, 15.7% (95% CrI 13.7–17.8), 47.9% (95% CrI 44.9–50.9), and 76·6% (95% CrI 74.0–79.1) of participants had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30, 50, and 75 nmol/l, respectively; the prevalence slightly decreased from 2000–2010 to 2011–2022, but it was still at a high level; people living in high latitude areas had a higher prevalence; the prevalence in winter-spring was 1.7 (95% CrI 1.4–2.0) times that in summer-autumn; the Eastern Mediterranean region and Lower-middle-income countries had a higher prevalence; females were vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency; gender, sampling frame, detection assays, sampling region, time of data collection, season, and other factors contributed to heterogeneity between the included studies. Interpretation: Globally, vitamin D deficiency remained prevalent from 2000 to 2022. The high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency would increase the global burden of disease. Therefore, governments, policymakers, health workers, and individuals should attach importance to the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and take its prevention as a public health priority.

Abstract Purpose Social distancing policies and school closures in South Korea induced by coronavirus disease 2019 have raised concerns about a lower chance of exposure to sunlight in children and adolescents. This study investigates changes in the vitamin D status of children and adolescents following the pandemic. Methods This retrospective study includes healthy children aged 3–18 years who visited Hanyang University Hospitals in Seoul or Guri during pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and post-COVID-19 pandemic periods. August 2017 to July 2019 is defined as the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period, while the period from July 2020 to July 2021 is defined as post-COVID-19 or "during the pandemic." Propensity scores were used to match the prepandemic and pandemic groups 1:1 based on age, sex, season of blood collection, and body mass index z-score to compare vitamin D status among subjects. Results Among 786 eligible children, 506 were matched using propensity scores. There were no significant differences in mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) levels (20.1±6.5 ng/mL vs. 19.9±6.3 ng/mL, P>0.05) or vitamin D deficiency rates (53.0% vs. 54.9%, P>0.05) between the prepandemic and pandemic groups. Seasonal analysis revealed lower mean serum 25(OH)D levels during the pandemic in winter/spring seasons in comparison to these levels in subjects in prepandemic winter/spring seasons (19.1±3.8 ng/mL vs. 17.2±3.7 ng/mL, P=0.006). Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, Korean children and adolescents showed similar serum 25(OH)D levels and vitamin D status to the prepandemic period, with a significant decrease in these measures observed in winter/spring seasons only. Prolonged confinement, such as in pandemic circumstances, underscores the need for vigilant monitoring of vitamin D status and supplementation, particularly in high-risk seasons.

Abstract: Governmental actions and public health recommendations during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in several restrictions on daily living, including social distancing. The impact of these long-term restrictions on health behaviors and lifestyles are unclear, but it could be related to vitamin D (VitD) deficiency. This study aimed to compare VitD levels in patients in pre-pandemic (PP) period and during the most important isolation period in pandemic (DP). We investigated 363,158 results of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D) levels from individuals who underwent health checks. The data was obtained from medical records during 2018–2019 (PP); and those results obtained from 2020 to 2021 (DP). 25OH-D levels were measured using a chemiluminescent assay (Siemens®). R software was used to statistical analysis and P value <0.05 was considered significant. 25OH-D levels were compared also regarding age ranges (<18, 18–64 and ≥65 years old) and sex of the individuals. The men group presented higher 25OH-D levels than women only in PP period. During the PP period, individuals <18 years old also showed higher 25OH-D levels. All age groups presented lower 25OH-D levels in DP period, however, the greatest reduction was observed in the group <18 years old. VitD evaluation and supplementation should be considered for overall population submitted to home confinement and social distancing due to COVID-19.

Received: 11 October 2023; Accepted: 15 November 2023; Published online: 19 December 2023. doi: 10.21037/jlpm-23-73 In a recent article published in this journal, Bretz and colleagues (1) report the interesting results of a vitamin D [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D)] investigation conducted in Brazilian patients in two different epochs, i.e., in the pre-pandemic (years 2018–2019) and pandemic (years 2020–2021) periods of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Overall, the 25OH-D levels were found slightly but significantly decreased during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period (−10%; 26.9 vs. 29.6 ng/mL; P<0.001). This is a relatively unexpected finding, as there is controversial evidence on this topic. Kwon et al. screened 1,483 Korean adults aged ≥19 years (2), and reported that the mean 25OH-D levels increased significantly during the national COVID-19 lockdown compared with the pre-pandemic period (23.6 vs. 21.4 ng/mL; P<0.001). In another study, we measured serum levels of 25OH-D in Italian subjects aged ≥18 years (3), and found that the hormone concentration did not significantly differ during the national COVID-19 lockdown compared to the same period of the previous two years (31.2 vs. 30.8 ng/mL; P=0.277). Consistent with these findings, Meoli et al. conducted a cross-sectional study in which serum 25OH-D levels were measured in 298 Swiss adolescents aged 18–19 years between July and December 2020 (4), and were compared with values obtained in a cohort of 437 matched adolescents from the years 2014–2016. During the pandemic, the serum levels of 25OH-D did not differ from the pre-pandemic period (30.8 vs. 29.6 ng/mL; P=0.50). So where does the truth lie? Did the COVID-19 pandemic really contribute to lower serum 25OH-D levels in certain populations, or is the relatively short duration of social restrictions (including lockdown and home confinement of positive cases) failing to generate a substantial impact on 25OH-D status? There is no simple answer to this question. The likelihood of developing 25OH-D deficiency depends on a kaleidoscope of demographic (age, sex, ethnicity, skin phenotype), clinical (renal function, malabsorption, therapies), lifestyle (diet, physical activity), and environmental conditions (sun exposure, seasonality) (5). No study designs or populations are therefore directly comparable to others, and this may largely help to explain why different investigations may yield even opposite findings. A second important consideration that needs to be made is the impact of 25OH-D deficiency on human health and, in particular, on COVID-19. A recent meta-analysis that included 21 studies showed that mortality did not differ significantly between COVID-19 patients with deficient and sufficient 25OH-D levels [relative risk (RR), 1.60; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93–2.27] (6). Moreover, the results of a recent systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials showed that 25OH-D supplementation did not contribute to improve the clinical course of COVID-19 (7), since it did not improve the risk of death (RR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.69–1.29; P=0.7), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.38–1.08; P=0.1), and mechanical ventilation or intubation (RR, 0.77; 95% CI: 0.58–1.02; P=0.1). Similar evidence emerged from another meta-analysis by Sîrbu and colleagues (8), published almost simultaneously, in which mortality in COVID-19 patients did not differ between those who did or did not receive 25OH-D supplementation (RR, 0.93; 95% CI: 0.57–1.52; P=0.78), although a marginally significant effect was found in terms of reduction in ICU admission (RR, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41–0.99; P=0.04). Overall, the situation is hence quite controversial, confirming previous evidence that public health policies based on 25OH-D supplementation (including food fortification) have uncertain effects on reducing the risk of adverse outcomes of acute or chronic diseases in the general population (9). It seems more appropriate to assert that the beneficial effects of 25OH-D supplementation may be limited to individuals with overt deficiency (e.g., <20 ng/mL) (10), who could benefit most from correcting their deficit. In summary, a pragmatic approach might be to routinely determine 25OH-D status in the most vulnerable and susceptible groups of the general population (i.e., patients with advanced age, multiple comorbidities, immunosuppression) who are at higher risk for developing adverse outcomes of COVID-19 and other severe of life-threatening pathologies, and to reserve vitamin D supplementation to those who are clearly deficient, as summarized in Figure 1.

When the lockdown was lifted, we observed an increased prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency(VDD) in adolescents. We want to highlight the effect of home lockdown on adolescents, which can predispose such children to VDD. Aim To document the increased prevalence of symptomatic VDD in adolescents after COVID lockdown and to study the symptoms, biochemical abnormalities, and response to therapy in this subset. Methods This prospective observational study was done from November 2021 to May 2022 with a minimum follow-up of six months. Inclusions Consecutive children presenting with gait abnormalities, proximal myopathy, and pains, with documented VDD. Exclusion: Genetic, neuromuscular disorders, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, chronic renal failure, thyroid disorders and those on anti-epileptic medications and vitamin D supplementation in the past 6 months were excluded from the study. We recorded the symptomatology, biochemical abnormalities, and muscle weakness and followed their improvement after Vitamin D and Calcium supplementation. Results A statistically significant increase in symptomatic VDD in adolescents, in six months post-lockdown was noted. Thirty-one adolescents between 9 to 14 years were studied. All cases were relieved of pain and muscle power normalized in 12 weeks. Conclusion Prolonged house arrest may cause VDD in adolescents. Physicians should consider VDD in adolescents with myopathy and pain after pandemic lockdowns. Supplementation of Vitamin D and calcium resolves most symptoms except deformities. Follow-up is needed until growth spurt completion for recurrence of symptoms.

However, it is also relevant to assess its performance in middle-high income countries, such as Chile, particularly given the post-pandemic food insecurity context. Aim To assess the use (frequency and doses) of daily recommended supplementation (iron (15–30 mg), folic acid (FA) (400–800 μg/day), and vitamin (VD) (400 IU)) in a sample of Chilean pregnant women. Methods In 1, 507 pregnant women selected from public health care registries of the Southeast area of Santiago-Chile, we collected maternal, supplement use, sociodemographic, and nutritional information at the first (<15 weeks), second (24–28 weeks), and third trimesters (32–36 weeks) of gestation by using a researcher administer online questionnaire. Results The median (IQR) age of women was 29 (25–33) years. Pre-conceptional supplementation was rare (24%), but it reached >93% in the first trimester; thereafter supplement use decreased to 79% in the second and 84% in the third trimesters, particularly in women with lower income (p<0.05), lower education (p<0.05), and with excess weight (p<0.05). Use of iron supplements in the first trimester was rare (<21%) as well as the use of VD supplements across pregnancy (<31%). Most FA (70%) and iron (80%) supplement users, exceeded the recommended daily dose while ~40% of VD users took less than the recommended dose. Conclusions In this sample of Chilean women, timely initiation of FA, iron, and VD supplementation was low and doses were not aligned with the recommendations. Strengthening adherence and quality of micronutrient supplementation programs delivered through public primary care could benefit particularly the most vulnerable women. Figures

Observational studies in adults showed that vitamin D deficiency is associated with Covid-19 severity. The aim of this review was to summarise data regarding the role of serum vitamin 25(OH)D concentration in the severity of Covid-19 and the associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Many studies noted lower concentrations of vitamin 25(OH)D in children with Covid-19 compared with healthy controls; however, studies that assessed vitamin 25(OH)D suboptimal concentrations as a risk factor for Covid-19 severity were scarce. There was no high-quality evidence that vitamin 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with Covid-19 severity. Similarly, for MIS-C, a few studies with a small number of patients found that vitamin D deficiency was associated with more severe MIS-C. Vitamin D has many immunomodulatory actions and is consumed in the immunomodulatory cells, especially in infections such as the Covid-19 which is associated with increased inflammation and cytokine storm. Therefore, decreased concentrations of plasma vitamin 25(OH)D have been proposed to be the result of vitamin use by immunomodulatory cells in severe Covid-19, rather than a predisposing factor. In conclusion, the available data cannot prove that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for severe Covid-19 disease. More studies, of prospective design, are needed to investigate the role of this marker independently of other risk factors.

Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is linked to several adverse events during pregnancy. While performing a cross-sectional study with 886 pregnant women in Elda (Spain) from September 2019 to July 2020 to determine the association of VDD with gestational diabetes mellitus in relation to body mass index, a strict lockdown (SL) due to the COVID-19 pandemic was declared from 15 March 2020 to 15 May 2020. To determine if VDD prevalence in the local population of pregnant women was influenced by SL, a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence odds ratio (POR) for the association of VDD and SL. A crude logistic regression model was calculated, and then further adjusted by the biweekly measured vitamin D-specific UVB dose in our geographical area. The POR during SL was 4.0 (95%CI = 2.7–5.7), with a VDD prevalence of 77.8% in the quarantine period. Our results revealed that VDD prevalence in pregnant women was influenced by SL. This valuable information could guide us in future if public officials order the population to stay indoors for any given reason.
